# Changelog for v0.1.1

## Highlights

First version of the library, with tests and documentation. Implements the `before`, `after`, `on_success`, `on_error` and `wrapper` strategies of intercepting any function. As of now, it only intercepts public functions (but it shouldn't be difficult to intercept private ones as well).
